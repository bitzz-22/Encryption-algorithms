# Encryption Algorithms Showcase

## Overview

This features my implementation of the **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** algorithm, written in C. AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm used worldwide to secure sensitive data.

### Features

- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** implementation
- Written in C for performance and control
- Supports 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit key sizes
- Example usage for encryption and decryption

## AES Algorithm

**AES** is a symmetric block cipher standardized by NIST. It operates on 128-bit blocks and supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits.

### Key Features:
- **Security**: High level of security with variable key lengths
- **Performance**: Optimized for both software and hardware implementations
- **Flexibility**: Commonly used in secure communications, data storage, and more

## Installation

To run the AES implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bitzz-22/Encryption-algorithms.git
   cd Encryption-algorithms/AES
